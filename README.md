# What is Project Pangaea?
Project Pangaea is a dinosaur mod created on the same basis as games like Jurassic Park: Operation Genesis or Jurassic World: Evolution. While DinoMod offers a world with dinosaurs in it, Project Pangaea aims to give you the tool to bring dinosaurs to this world yourself. The mod is very much leaning in the direction of Jurassic Park-esque science fiction with the entire genetics and cloning aspect.

# What can make it in?
- Any generally accepted extinct taxa (animal or plant) with some decent material to go off. Yes, Project Pangaea is not limiting itself to just the Mesozoic. Anything from Cambrian to Holocene goes, although with the Holocene stuff it's probably going to be harder to make generic fossil items.
- Modern animals, plants, or microorganisms which are either model organisms in some field related to genetics/developmental science, or just make sense to be experimented on in the mod facilities

# What ***can't*** make it in?
- Dubious taxa. Yes, this means that *Troodon*, *Dracorex*, and *Stygimoloch* are out. At least until *Stygimoloch* gets some new paper
- Modern animals that are too rare or unviable to experiment on. This unfortunately includes the likes of Coelacanths and Goblin Sharks, for example

# What's on the fence?
- Zombie and fungal versions of all the creatures. No reason against them, but I am not interested in adding those myself
- I may be persuaded to allow some more common living fossils, but this is a slippery slope

# So why is this a thing actually?
Project Pangaea actually started as a RimWorld mod inspired by a minecraft mod. Yeah, it's as ridiculous as it sounds. For 4 years I left the idea to rot because I figured with DinoMod existing there was no niche for this concept. I now believe that thought was wrong. This is a fundamentally different experience than what DinoMod provides, and I consider each of those experiences valid.
